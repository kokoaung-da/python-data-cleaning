# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects with Python

This repository contains a collection of data cleaning projects built using Python. Each project focuses on transforming raw, unstructured, or inconsistent datasets into clean, organized, and analysis-ready data. The goal is to demonstrate practical, real-world data cleaning techniques that can be reused or adapted for your own workflows.

📌 Overview

Data cleaning is one of the most important steps in any data pipeline. These projects walk through hands-on examples of how to:

Detect and handle missing values

Identify and treat outliers

Normalize and clean messy text data

Correct inconsistent data types

Address duplicates and structural issues

Validate the quality of the cleaned results

The projects are designed to be easy to explore, with each workflow documented in Jupyter notebooks.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

These projects make use of widely adopted Python libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

regex (re) for text cleaning

Jupyter Notebook for interactive workflows

✨ Key Cleaning Techniques Covered
✔ Missing Data Handling

Detecting patterns of missingness

Filling, imputing, or removing values safely

✔ Outlier Detection

Rule-based and statistical techniques

✔ Text Cleaning & Standardization

Removing noise and unwanted characters

Standardizing formats and extracting structured info

✔ Data Type Corrections

Converting strings to numeric, datetime, or categorical values

✔ Duplicate & Consistency Checks

Finding exact and near-duplicate entries

Cleaning inconsistent labels and categories

✔ Structural Improvements

Renaming unclear columns

Splitting, merging, or reshaping datasets

Ensuring tidy data format
